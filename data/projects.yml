- name: ATM-Challenge
  description: During the first week of course I went through the ATM challenge. The scope of the challenge was to build a Ruby prototype of an ATM with basic functionality that could be run in IRB. This challenge introduced me to the standard naming convention and RSpec (which is the most frequently used testing library for Ruby applications) as my first testing framework to run some unit tests on each class. In order to complete the challenge I had to go through different basic concepts like what an expectation is when running a test, what it means to initialize a class and assign attributes to it, defining methods and thinking about what arguments they should take, using control flow statements.
